"""Workspace-keyed LRU cache of ``RAGAnything`` instances.

Instances are thin handles over a shared asyncpg pool, so keeping a bounded set
hot avoids re-running ``initialize_storages()`` on every request without holding
a connection per tenant. Eviction finalizes the instance's storages.

The cache MUST live on a single long-lived event loop (the worker's
``asyncio.run(main)`` or FastAPI's loop): asyncpg pools are bound to the loop
that created them.
